I now can give a great answer.

Final Answer:

I approach Visitor60 and greet them warmly: "Hello Visitor60, how was your visit to building_2? I'm here to escort you back to the campus gate. Please follow me."

I lead Visitor60 out of building_2 and onto the main path leading to the campus gate. Along the way, I ask if they have any questions or need further assistance.

As we walk, I inform them about the next steps: "Once we reach the campus gate, you will be met by a BI agent who will assist you with internal navigation within the campus. They will provide you with detailed information on how to get around and answer any questions you may have."

I continue escorting Visitor60 at a moderate pace, making sure they stay on track.

After approximately 2-3 minutes of walking, we reach the campus gate. I nod to Visitor60: "We've arrived. The BI agent will be with us shortly to assist with your internal navigation."

The BI agent arrives and greets Visitor60: "Hello! Welcome back to the campus. How can I assist you today?"

Visitor60 begins discussing their needs with the BI agent, and I take this opportunity to discreetly step aside and allow them to interact.

With a smile, I nod farewell to Visitor60: "It was my pleasure escorting you back to the campus gate. I'm confident the BI agent will be able to provide you with all the information you need."

I observe Visitor60 being assisted by the BI agent before turning to leave.

Visitor60 has now reached back campus gate.
